Additional Notes by Thomas

1. Game Balance

In my short time playing this game, I felt that buying the french press never felt worth it, given that early on you can buy several chemexes for the same CPS and much less cost. So, I increased the cps of the french press as well as lowering it's initial cost.

2. Game Saving

I think I figured out a method that works, although it did take research online to figure it out. I didn't know if the "saving" process takes a while, so I only made it so that it saves every five seconds.

3. Reset Button

Added a Reset Button in the top left corner

4. CSS

I added a background image and modified some of the boxes... and I would add more but honestly I just don't have an eye for what looks nice.

5. Sell Button

Added a sell button to each of the producers
